## SVM

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of data mining,providing robust solutions for classification, regression, and anomaly detection tasks. This paperpresents a comprehensive overview of SVM's principles, algorithms, and applications in data mining.
Initially developed for binary classification, SVM has evolved to handle multi-class classification andregression tasks efficiently. Its core principle revolves around finding an optimal hyperplane that
maximizes the margin between different classes in the feature space, ensuring generalization androbustness to noise. Various kernel functions, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF),
and sigmoid, enable SVM to effectively handle non-linear separable data. We delve into the intricacies of SVM algorithms, including the mathematical formulations for marginoptimization and the dual problem formulation, which facilitates efficient computation, particularly in
high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, advancements like kernel trick and soft-margin SVM enhance SVM's flexibility and applicability to real-world datasets with noise and overlapping classes
